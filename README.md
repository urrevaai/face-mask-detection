# face-mask-detection
This project focuses on the development of a robust, accurate, and fast face mask detection model that can be integrated into various environments.The system will use deep learning frameworks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify images or video streams into two categories: "mask" and "no mask." It will also incorporate techniques for real-time detection, ensuring smooth and efficient operation in real-world scenarios. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of AI-based solutions in enhancing public safety and supporting health initiatives in critical times.
